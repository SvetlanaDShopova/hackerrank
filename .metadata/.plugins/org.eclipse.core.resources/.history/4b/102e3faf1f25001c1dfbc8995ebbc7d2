 * Given two strings of lower case English letters, A and B , perform the following operations:
 * 1. Sum the lengths of A and B.
 * 2. Determine if A  is lexicographically larger than B
 *    (i.e.: does B  come before A in the dictionary?).
 * 3. Capitalize the first letter in A  and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
